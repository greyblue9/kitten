# kitten (AKA "Test Kitten 1.0")

A variation of Mikko's chat bot that uses local
"artificial intelligence" ML files (`.aiml` files
in the `alice/aiml` folder) for its intelligence.

This discord bot is based on Mikko's bot here (and shares 95% of its code:)
[AI Discord Chat Bot](https://replit.com/@mikkos/AI-Discord-Chat-Bot)

The intelligence part is from my fork of pyAimlEx,
which is in this repo:
[greyblue9/pyAimlEx](https://github.com/greyblue9/pyaimlEx)

Which in turn is a fork of the original
[zhangziliang04/pyAimlEx](https://github.com/zhangziliang04/pyaimlEx)
with added logging, Chinese learning files removed, and
some tweaks to help it better remember the users' responses.

Enjoy!
