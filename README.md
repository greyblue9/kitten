# kitten (AKA "Test Kitten 1.0")

A variation of Mikko's chat bot that uses local
"artificial intelligence" ML files (`.aiml` files
in the `alice/aiml` folder) for its intelligence.

This discord bot is based on Mikko's bot here (and shares 95% of its code:)
(AI Discord Chat Bot)[https://replit.com/@mikkos/AI-Discord-Chat-Bot]

The intelligence part is from my fork of pyAimlEx,
which is in this repo:
(greyblue9/pyAimlEx)[https://github.com/greyblue9/pyaimlEx]

Which in turn is a fork of the original
(pyAimlEx)[https://github.com/zhangziliang04/pyaimlEx]
with added logging, Chinese learning files removed, and
some tweaks to help it better remember the users' responses.

Enjoy!
